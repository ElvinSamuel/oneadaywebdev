# Cornucopia - There's Enough For Us All.

## Every year millions of tons of food goes to waste. 
## Every year millions of people go unfed.
## Let's put an end to both.

### Cornucopia is a global initiative to incentivize producers to provide for those in need. With so many that cannot afford another way, we push to provide a means for everyone to eat. We can find a way for everyone to benefit.
